I have seen many `freelancing` websites and once i worked on freelancing company. With in few weeks i became a developer/Business Analyst. Slowly my work deviates from writing fun code to becoming an bidding analyst. When i see my past after 3 months it feels like i am doing work which is like showcasing our skills every time when new client comes. This is where i find Toptal. I would like to join at Toptal Ruby on Rails Freelancers Network.

What i like most about Toptal is we do not need to worry about showing our skills every time when new client comes. It remembers `DRY` principle to me. So finally here i am with Toptal as a Ruby on Rails developer.


###### Skill set

* I'm good at developing complex applications in either ruby on rails/Sinatra.

* I can manage Search Engine Optimization pretty good.

* Familiar with Nginx/Passenger. 

* Can be able to work with virtual boxes(vagrant)


My favorite application [FitnessPapa](https://fitnesspapa.com) where i am the only person take care of application from designing to deployment. While developing, i have learnt how to deal with requirements so we can easily go with re factoring every time new change request comes. My skill set increases on solr, Restful API and React.js after i have developed FitnessPapa. 

I can conclude that i am one of the best fit for clients who may want to develop applications on Ruby on Rails/Sinatra.
