Hi, I'm [Siddharth](https://github.com/sidtri). I'm a programmer, cyclist and mildly obsessed with [game of thrones](http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones).

I work with small business owners and bloggers (like you!) to simplify owning a website. Whether thatâ€™s working together to turn your vision into a reality via a beautiful new design or sharing my knowledge on the blog to help you conquer your coding fears, I love helping people turn their dream site into a reality.
